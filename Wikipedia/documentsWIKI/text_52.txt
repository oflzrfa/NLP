Joanne Rowling CH OBE FRSL (/ˈroʊlɪŋ/ "rolling";  born 31 July 1965), best known by her pen name J. K. Rowling, is a British author and philanthropist.
She wrote Harry Potter, a seven-volume children's fantasy series published from 1997 to 2007.
The series has sold over 600 million copies, been translated into 84 languages, and spawned a global media franchise including films and video games.
The Casual Vacancy (2012) was her first novel for adults.
She writes Cormoran Strike, an ongoing crime fiction series, under the alias Robert Galbraith.Born in Yate, Gloucestershire, Rowling was working as a researcher and bilingual secretary for Amnesty International in 1990 when she conceived the idea for the Harry Potter series while on a delayed train from Manchester to London.
The seven-year period that followed saw the death of her mother, the birth of her first child, divorce from her first husband, and relative poverty until the first novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was published in 1997.
Six sequels followed, and by 2008, Forbes had named her the world's highest-paid author.
Rowling concluded the Harry Potter series with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (2007).
The novels follow a boy called Harry Potter as he attends Hogwarts (a school for wizards), and battles Lord Voldemort.
Death and the divide between good and evil are the central themes of the series.
Its influences include Bildungsroman (the coming-of-age genre), school stories, fairy tales, and Christian allegory.
The series revived fantasy as a genre in the children's market, spawned a host of imitators, and inspired an active fandom.
Critical reception has been more mixed.
Many reviewers see Rowling's writing as conventional; some regard her portrayal of gender and social division as regressive.
There were also religious debates over Harry Potter.Rowling has won many accolades for her work.
She has received an OBE and made a Companion of Honour for services to literature and philanthropy.
Harry Potter brought her wealth and recognition, which she has used to advance philanthropic endeavours and political causes.
She co-founded the charity Lumos and established the Volant Charitable Trust, named after her mother.
Rowling's charitable giving centres on medical causes and supporting at-risk women and children.
In politics, she has donated to Britain's Labour Party and opposed Scottish independence and Brexit.
Since late 2019, she has publicly expressed her opinions on transgender people and related civil rights.
These have been criticised as transphobic by LGBT rights organisations and some feminists, but have received support from other feminists and individuals.Although she writes under the pen name J. K. Rowling, before her remarriage her name was Joanne Rowling,  or Jo.
At birth, she had no middle name.
Staff at Bloomsbury Publishing asked that she use two initials rather than her full name, anticipating that young boys – their target audience – would not want to read a book written by a woman.
She chose K (for Kathleen) as the second initial of her pen name, from her paternal grandmother, and because of the ease of pronunciation of two consecutive letters.
Following her 2001 remarriage,  she has sometimes used the name Joanne Murray when conducting personal business.
Joanne Rowling was born on 31 July 1965 at Cottage Hospital in Yate, Gloucestershire [b] to a middle-class family.
Her parents Anne (née Volant) and Peter ("Pete") James Rowling had met the previous year on a train, sharing a trip from King's Cross station, London, to their naval postings at Arbroath, Scotland.
Anne was with the Wrens and Pete was with the Royal Navy.
Pete was the son of a machine-tool setter who later opened a grocery shop.
They left the navy life and sought a country home to raise the baby they were expecting,  and married on 14 March 1965  when both were 19.
The Rowlings settled in Yate,  where Pete started work as an assembly-line production worker at the Bristol Siddeley factory.
The company became part of Rolls-Royce,  and he worked his way into management as a chartered engineer.
Anne later worked as a science technician.
Neither Anne nor Pete attended university.
Joanne is two years older than her sister, Dianne.
When Joanne was four, the family moved to Winterbourne, Gloucestershire.
She began at St Michael's Church of England Primary School in Winterbourne when she was five.
[c] The Rowlings lived near a family called Potter – a name Joanne always liked.
[d] Anne loved to read and their homes were filled with books.
Pete read The Wind in the Willows to his daughters,  while Anne introduced them to the animals in Richard Scarry's books.
Joanne's first attempt at writing, a story called "Rabbit" composed when she was six, was inspired by Scarry's creatures.
When Rowling was about nine, the family purchased the historic Church Cottage in Tutshill.
[e] In 1974, Rowling began attending the nearby Church of England School.
Biographer Sean Smith describes her teacher as a "battleaxe"  who "struck fear into the hearts of the children";  she seated Rowling in "dunces' row" after she performed poorly on an arithmetic test.
[f] In 1975, Rowling joined a Brownies pack.
Its special events and parties, and the pack groups (Fairies, Pixies, Sprites, Elves, Gnomes and Imps) provided a magical world away from her stern teacher.
When she was eleven  or twelve, she wrote a short story, "The Seven Cursed Diamonds".
She later described herself during this period as "the epitome of a bookish child – short and squat, thick National Health glasses, living in a world of complete daydreams".
Rowling's secondary school was Wyedean School and College, a state school she began attending at the age of eleven  and where she was bullied.
