Medical racism in the United States encompasses discriminatory and targeted medical practices and misrepresentations in medical teachings driven by biases based on characteristics of patients' race and ethnicity.
In American history, it has impacted various racial and ethnic groups and affected their health outcomes.
Vulnerable subgroups within these racial and ethnic groups such as women, children and the poor have been especially endangered over the years.
An ongoing phenomenon since at least the 18th century in the United States, medical racism has been evident on a widespread basis through various unethical studies, forced procedures, and differential treatments administered by health care providers, researchers, and even sometimes government entities.
Whether medical racism is always caused by explicitly prejudiced beliefs about patients based on race or by unconscious bias is not widely agreed upon.
In a modern context, medical racism and its history has created a deep distrust of health professionals and their practices in certain racial and ethnic groups.
Studies within the last couple decades have elucidated varied treatment from health professionals still occurring that reveal racial biases.
These racial biases have impacted the way in which substances such as painkillers are prescribed or the rate at which diagnostic tests are given.
Black patients in particular have a long history of contrasting medical treatment based on different perceptions of the pain thresholds of Black people.
However, medical racism has not been limited to Black people in the United States.
While infamous studies like the Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male may be known, the U.S. Public Health Service Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Inoculation Study of 1946-1948 notably impacted Guatemalan prisoners, sex workers, soldiers, and mental health patients in a detrimental fashion by purposely infecting victims with STDs such as syphilis and gonorrhea.
The push to forcibly sterilize Indigenous women as young as 15 years old occurred from 1970 to 1976 by the Indian Health Service as revealed in researcher Jane Lawrence's paper "The Indian Health Service and the Sterilization of Native American Women."
These are only a few examples of the many that exist in American history of the unethical actions of health care providers, researchers, and government entities pertaining to the health services of minority groups.
Physicians not possessing the appropriate level of cultural competence as it pertains to their patient demographic can lead to adverse impacts to those patients due to poor relationship dynamics and contribute to medical racism.
Cultural incompetence exists for a number of reasons such as lack of diversity in medical education and lack of diverse members of medical school student and faculty populations.
This leads to marginalization of both minority healthcare providers and minority patients.
Studies done on the curriculums of medical schools in the US have found that within the assigned textbook readings, there exists a disparity between the representation of race and skin color in textbook case studies relative to the US population.
This is true for both visual and textual lecture materials.
A group of studies done on the representation of race and gender in course slides for the University of Washington School of Medicine, preclinical lecture slides at the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University and case studies used at the University of Minnesota Medical School simultaneously showed associations of race as a "risk factor" and a lack of racial diversity.
The study done on the University of Minnesota Medical School employed the use of the concept of hidden curriculum to describe the ways in which lack of representation and informal teachings can greatly influence the minds of aspiring physicians.
The interactions had between students and faculty or the transmission of unintentional messages can be just as, if not more, influential than formal lectures.
These can include the associations of diseases such as sickle cell anemia as a "black disease" and cystic fibrosis as a "white disease" which leads to poor health outcomes.
In this study, the 1996-1998 year one and year two curriculums of the school were analyzed.
It revealed that only 4.5% of the case studies mentioned a racial or ethnic background of the patient and when the patient was black or had "potentially unfavorable characteristics" race or ethnicity was more likely to be identified.
There was also a greater prevalence of health-related themes discussed when race or ethnicity was identified.
Researchers determined that the inclusion of specific racial or ethnic identities in those cases was intended to indicate something about that disease or health condition.
Implications such as these contributes to the racialization of diseases.
A study of specific medical textbooks has also yielded much information on minority representation in medical teachings.
Based on the required texts of the top 20 ranked medical schools in North America, US editions of Atlas of Human Anatomy (2014), Bates' Guide to Physical Examination and History Taking (2013), Clinically Oriented Anatomy (2014), and Gray's Anatomy for Students (2015) were chosen for the study.
Using the total 4146 images from the four textbooks that depicted visible faces, arms, heads, and skin, researchers discovered two of three books were close in diversity to the US population, one book displayed "diversity on basis of equal representation" and one matched neither definition of diversity.
On a topic level there were also issues of diversity.
When discussing health issues such as skin cancers three of four books included no imagery at all and the one book that did had only imagery of white and light-skinned patients.
According to researchers, symptoms might manifest differently depending on skin tone.
Missed indicators may go unreported if there is a lack of education on how to recognize these discrepancies.
Some medical students have also done their own research and added to the discourse on underrepresentation in medical school education.
They've noted specific examples such as skin infections like erythema migrans being depicted on almost exclusively white skin.
As an indicative first symptom of lyme disease, a lack of knowledge on how to detect this rash on patients with darker skin colors means failed diagnoses of the disease.
Studies have shown that there is in fact a delay in lyme disease diagnoses for black patients.
The lack of representation in medical school lectures risks creating adverse impacts on the health outcomes of minority populations in the US.
According to US Census data, black and Hispanic people account for 13% and 18% of the overall population, respectively.
However, they only make up 6% and 5% of medical school graduates, respectively.
Black physicians make up only about 3% of American doctors.
Black physicians in particular have historically faced numerous obstacles to obtaining membership in the larger medical community.
During the 20th century in the United States, groups such as the American Medical Association neglected black physicians and their pursuit of success in the field of medicine.
This has led to continued marginalization of black physicians in the US due to their small numbers among other factors and this contributes to the marginalization of black patients.
Minorities often perceive medical facilities as "white spaces" because of a lack of diversity at the institutional level.
The dehumanization of certain racial groups such as black people can also contribute to disparities in healthcare due to varied perceptions, by physicians, of concepts such as pain tolerance and cooperation â€“ one aspect of medical racism.
In American history, social Darwinism has been utilized to justify American chattel slavery among other historical practices and the racist ideas about black people it created persisted into the 20th century.
The Three-Fifths Compromise worked also to reinforce the notion that black people were less than human.
However, this has not just been relegated to the past.
