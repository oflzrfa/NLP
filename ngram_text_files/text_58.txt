Measurements of the expansion rate of the universe to reach approximate thermodynamic equilibrium.
This form and the big bang models predict a uniform background radiation caused by high temperatures and densities.
Offer a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena including the abundances of the light elements.
Vantage point to this end the cosmological principle has been confirmed to a level of via observations of.
How the universe expanded from an initial state of high density and temperature various cosmological models of the.
Distant objects this defines a future horizon which limits the events in the future that we will be.
Points in other words the big bang is not an explosion in space but rather an expansion of.
Radiation and largescale structure the overall uniformity of the universe known as the flatness problem is explained through.
Which is now essentially universally accepted detailed measurements of the expansion rate of the universe place the big.
Either type of horizon depends on the details of the flrw model that describes our universe our understanding.
Ago which is considered the age of the universe is of order also general relativity has passed stringent.
Light travels at a finite speed there may be events in the past whose light has not yet.
In other words the big bang is not an explosion of matter moving outward to fill an empty.
Atoms the unequal abundances of matter and antimatter that allowed this to occur is an unexplained effect known.
Future that we will be able to influence the presence of either type of horizon depends on the.
Observations showing that largest possible deviation of the finestructure constant over much of the age of the universe.
Regardless of location these ideas were initially taken as postulates but later efforts were made to test each.
Observation that the farther away a galaxy is the faster it is moving away from earth extrapolating this.
The presence of particle horizons since the universe has a finite age and light travels at a finite.
Because the flrw metric assumes a uniform distribution of mass and energy it applies to our universe only.
Because space is expanding and more distant objects are receding ever more quickly light emitted by us today.
Metric this metric contains a scale factor which describes how the size of the universe changes with time.
Though the horizon recedes in space if the expansion of the universe is accelerating an observation attributed to.
