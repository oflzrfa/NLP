The Maya civilization (/ˈmaɪə/) of the Mesoamerican people is known by its ancient temples and glyphs.
Its Maya script is the most sophisticated and highly developed writing system in the pre-Columbian Americas.
It is also noted for its art, architecture, mathematics, calendar, and astronomical system.
The Maya civilization developed in the Maya Region, an area that today comprises southeastern Mexico, all of Guatemala and Belize, and the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador.
It includes the northern lowlands of the Yucatán Peninsula and the highlands of the Sierra Madre, the Mexican state of Chiapas, southern Guatemala, El Salvador, and the southern lowlands of the Pacific littoral plain.
Today, their descendants, known collectively as the Maya, number well over 6 million individuals, speak more than twenty-eight surviving Mayan languages, and reside in nearly the same area as their ancestors.The Archaic period, before 2000 BC, saw the first developments in agriculture and the earliest villages.
The Preclassic period (c. 2000 BC to 250 AD) saw the establishment of the first complex societies in the Maya region, and the cultivation of the staple crops of the Maya diet, including maize, beans, squashes, and chili peppers.
The first Maya cities developed around 750 BC, and by 500 BC these cities possessed monumental architecture, including large temples with elaborate stucco façades.
Hieroglyphic writing was being used in the Maya region by the 3rd century BC.
In the Late Preclassic a number of large cities developed in the Petén Basin, and the city of Kaminaljuyu rose to prominence in the Guatemalan Highlands.
Beginning around 250 AD, the Classic period is largely defined as when the Maya were raising sculpted monuments with Long Count dates.
This period saw the Maya civilization develop many city-states linked by a complex trade network.
In the Maya Lowlands two great rivals, the cities of Tikal and Calakmul, became powerful.
The Classic period also saw the intrusive intervention of the central Mexican city of Teotihuacan in Maya dynastic politics.
In the 9th century, there was a widespread political collapse in the central Maya region, resulting in internecine warfare, the abandonment of cities, and a northward shift of population.
The Postclassic period saw the rise of Chichen Itza in the north, and the expansion of the aggressive Kʼicheʼ kingdom in the Guatemalan Highlands.
In the 16th century, the Spanish Empire colonised the Mesoamerican region, and a lengthy series of campaigns saw the fall of Nojpetén, the last Maya city, in 1697.Rule during the Classic period centred on the concept of the "divine king", who was thought to act as a mediator between mortals and the supernatural realm.
Kingship was patrilineal, and power normally passed to the eldest son.
A prospective king was expected to be a successful war leader as well as a ruler.
Closed patronage systems were the dominant force in Maya politics, although how patronage affected the political makeup of a kingdom varied from city-state to city-state.
By the Late Classic period, the aristocracy had grown in size, reducing the previously exclusive power of the king.
The Maya developed sophisticated art forms using both perishable and non-perishable materials, including wood, jade, obsidian, ceramics, sculpted stone monuments, stucco, and finely painted murals.Maya cities tended to expand organically.
The city centers comprised ceremonial and administrative complexes, surrounded by an irregularly shaped sprawl of residential districts.
Different parts of a city were often linked by causeways.
Architecturally, city buildings included palaces, pyramid-temples, ceremonial ballcourts, and structures specially aligned for astronomical observation.
The Maya elite were literate, and developed a complex system of hieroglyphic writing.
Theirs was the most advanced writing system in the pre-Columbian Americas.
The Maya recorded their history and ritual knowledge in screenfold books, of which only three uncontested examples remain, the rest having been destroyed by the Spanish.
In addition, a great many examples of Maya texts can be found on stelae and ceramics.
The Maya developed a highly complex series of interlocking ritual calendars, and employed mathematics that included one of the earliest known instances of the explicit zero in human history.
As a part of their religion, the Maya practised human sacrifice.
"Maya" is a modern term used to refer collectively to the various peoples that inhabited this area.
They did not call themselves "Maya" and did not have a sense of common identity or political unity.
The Maya civilization developed within the Maya Region, a Mesoamerican cultural area, which covers a region that spreads from northern Mexico southwards into Central America.
Mesoamerica was one of six cradles of civilization worldwide.
The Mesoamerican area gave rise to a series of cultural developments that included complex societies, agriculture, cities, monumental architecture, writing, and calendrical systems.
The set of traits shared by Mesoamerican cultures also included astronomical knowledge, blood and human sacrifice, and a cosmovision that viewed the world as divided into four divisions aligned with the cardinal directions, each with different attributes, and a three-way division of the world into the celestial realm, the earth, and the underworld.
By 6000 BC, the early inhabitants of Mesoamerica were experimenting with the domestication of plants, a process that eventually led to the establishment of sedentary agricultural societies.
The diverse climate allowed for wide variation in available crops, but all regions of Mesoamerica cultivated the base crops of maize, beans, and squashes.
All Mesoamerican cultures used Stone Age technology; after c. 1000 AD copper, silver and gold were worked.
Mesoamerica lacked draft animals, did not use the wheel, and possessed few domesticated animals; the principal means of transport was on foot or by canoe.
Mesoamericans viewed the world as hostile and governed by unpredictable deities.
The ritual Mesoamerican ballgame was widely played.
Mesoamerica is linguistically diverse, with most languages falling within a small number of language families—the major families are Mayan, Mixe–Zoquean, Otomanguean, and Uto-Aztecan; there are also a number of smaller families and isolates.
The Mesoamerican language area shares a number of important features, including widespread loanwords, and use of a vigesimal number system.
The territory of the Maya covered a third of Mesoamerica,  and the Maya were engaged in a dynamic relationship with neighbouring cultures that included the Olmecs, Mixtecs, Teotihuacan, the Aztecs, and others.
During the Early Classic period, the Maya cities of Tikal and Kaminaljuyu were key Maya foci in a network that extended beyond the Maya area into the highlands of central Mexico.
At around the same time, there was a strong Maya presence at the Tetitla compound of Teotihuacan.
Centuries later, during the 9th century AD, murals at Cacaxtla, another site in the central Mexican highlands, were painted in a Maya style.
This may have been either an effort to align itself with the still-powerful Maya area after the collapse of Teotihuacan and ensuing political fragmentation in the Mexican Highlands,  or an attempt to express a distant Maya origin of the inhabitants.
