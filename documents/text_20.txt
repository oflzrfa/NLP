The Holocaust, also known as the Shoah,[a] was the genocide of European Jews during World War II.
[b] Between 1941 and 1945, Nazi Germany and its collaborators systematically murdered some six million Jews across German-occupied Europe;[c] around two-thirds of Europe's Jewish population.
[d] The murders were carried out in pogroms and mass shootings; by a policy of extermination through labor in concentration camps; and in gas chambers and gas vans in German extermination camps, chiefly Auschwitz-Birkenau, Bełżec, Chełmno, Majdanek, Sobibór, and Treblinka in occupied Poland.
Germany implemented the persecution in stages.
Following Adolf Hitler's appointment as chancellor on 30 January 1933, the regime built a network of concentration camps in Germany for political opponents and those deemed "undesirable", starting with Dachau on 22 March 1933.
After the passing of the Enabling Act on 24 March,  which gave Hitler dictatorial plenary powers, the government began isolating Jews from civil society; this included boycotting Jewish businesses in April 1933 and enacting the Nuremberg Laws in September 1935.
On 9–10 November 1938, eight months after Germany annexed Austria, Jewish businesses and other buildings were ransacked or set on fire throughout Germany and Austria on what became known as Kristallnacht (the "Night of Broken Glass").
After Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, triggering World War II, the regime set up ghettos to segregate Jews.
Eventually, thousands of camps and other detention sites were established across German-occupied Europe.The segregation of Jews in ghettos culminated in the policy of extermination the Nazis called the Final Solution to the Jewish Question, discussed by senior government officials at the Wannsee Conference in Berlin in January 1942.
As German forces captured territories in the East, all anti-Jewish measures were radicalized.
Under the coordination of the SS, with directions from the highest leadership of the Nazi Party, killings were committed within Germany itself, throughout occupied Europe, and within territories controlled by Germany's allies.
Paramilitary death squads called Einsatzgruppen, in cooperation with the German Army and local collaborators, murdered around 1.3 million Jews in mass shootings and pogroms from the summer of 1941.
By mid-1942, victims were being deported from ghettos across Europe in sealed freight trains to extermination camps where, if they survived the journey, they were gassed, worked or beaten to death, or killed by disease, starvation, cold, medical experiments, or during death marches.
The killing continued until the end of World War II in Europe in May 1945.The Holocaust is understood as being primarily the genocide of the Jews, but during the Holocaust era  (1933–1945), systematic mass-killings of other population groups occurred.
These included Roma, Poles, Ukrainians, Soviet civilians and prisoners of war, and other targeted populations.
Smaller groups were also victims of deadly Nazi persecution, such as Jehovah's Witnesses, Black Germans, disabled people, communists, and homosexuals.
The first recorded use of the term holocaust in its modern sense was made in 1895 by The New York Times to describe the massacre of Armenian Christians by Ottoman forces.
The term comes from the Greek: ὁλόκαυστος, romanized: holókaustos; ὅλος hólos, "whole" + καυστός kaustós, "burnt offering".
[e] The biblical term shoah (Hebrew: שׁוֹאָה), meaning "calamity" (and also used to refer to "destruction" since the Middle Ages), became the standard Hebrew term for the murder of the European Jews.
According to Haaretz, the writer Yehuda Erez may have been the first to describe events in Germany as the shoah.
Davar and later Haaretz both used the term in September 1939.
[f]On 3 October 1941 the American Hebrew used the phrase "before the Holocaust", apparently to refer to the situation in France,  and in May 1943 the New York Times, discussing the Bermuda Conference, referred to the "hundreds of thousands of European Jews still surviving the Nazi Holocaust".
In 1968 the Library of Congress created a new category, "Holocaust, Jewish (1939–1945)".
The term was popularised in the United States by the NBC mini-series Holocaust (1978) about a fictional family of German Jews,  and in November that year the President's Commission on the Holocaust was established.
As non-Jewish groups began to include themselves as Holocaust victims, many Jews chose to use the Hebrew terms Shoah or Churban.
[g] The Nazis used the phrase "Final Solution to the Jewish Question" (German: die Endlösung der Judenfrage).
Holocaust historians commonly define the Holocaust as the genocide of the European Jews by Nazi Germany and its collaborators between 1941 and 1945.
[b] Donald Niewyk and Francis Nicosia, in The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust (2000), favor a definition that includes the Jews, Roma, and disabled people: "the systematic, state-sponsored murder of entire groups determined by heredity".
[h]Other groups targeted after Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in January 1933  include those whom the Nazis viewed as inherently inferior (some Slavic people, particularly Poles and Russians,  the Roma, and the disabled), and those targeted because of their beliefs or behavior (such as Jehovah's Witnesses, communists, and homosexuals).
Peter Hayes writes that the persecution of these groups was less uniform than that of the Jews.
For example, the Nazis' treatment of the Slavs consisted of "enslavement and gradual attrition", while some Slavs were favored; Hayes lists Bulgarians, Croats, Slovaks, and some Ukrainians.
In contrast, according to historian Dan Stone, Hitler regarded the Jews as "a Gegenrasse: a 'counter-race' ... not really human at all".
The logistics of the mass murder turned Germany into what Michael Berenbaum called a "genocidal state".
Eberhard Jäckel wrote in 1986 that it was the first time a state had thrown its power behind the idea that an entire people should be wiped out.
[i] In total, 165,200 German Jews were murdered.
Anyone with three or four Jewish grandparents was to be exterminated,  and complex rules were devised to deal with Mischlinge ("mixed breeds").
Bureaucrats identified who was a Jew, confiscated property, and scheduled trains to deport them.
Companies fired Jews and later used them as slave labor.
Universities dismissed Jewish faculty and students.
German pharmaceutical companies tested drugs on camp prisoners; other companies built the crematoria.
As prisoners entered the death camps, they surrendered all personal property,  which was cataloged and tagged before being sent to Germany for reuse or recycling.
Through a concealed account, the German National Bank helped launder valuables stolen from the victims.
At least 7,000 camp inmates were subjected to medical experiments; most died during them or as a result.
The experiments, which took place at Auschwitz, Buchenwald, Dachau, Natzweiler-Struthof, Neuengamme, Ravensbrück, and Sachsenhausen, sought to uncover strategies to counteract chemical weapons, survive harsh environments, develop new vaccines and drugs and treat wounds.
Many men and women were also involuntarily sterilized.
After the war, 23 senior physicians and other medical personnel were charged at Nuremberg with crimes against humanity.
They included the head of the German Red Cross, tenured professors, clinic directors, and biomedical researchers.
The most notorious physician was Josef Mengele, an SS officer who became the Auschwitz camp doctor on 30 May 1943.
Interested in genetics,  and keen to experiment on twins, he would pick out subjects on the ramp from the new arrivals during "selection" (to decide who would be gassed immediately and who would be used as slave labor), shouting "Zwillinge heraus!"
(twins step forward!).
