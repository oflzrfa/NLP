He grew up with the worldâ€™s best waves but Rio Waida found surfing success the hard way

Rio Waida, an Indonesian surfer, has emerged as one of the world's top surfers despite facing numerous challenges on his journey to success. Born into a family of surf enthusiasts on the picturesque island of Bali, Rio's initial experiences with surfing were marked by fear and apprehension. With the support of his parents, who coaxed him onto a surfboard and ventured out into the ocean with him, Rio overcame his fears and developed a deep passion for the sport.

Reflecting on his early days, Rio recalls that his love for surfing began to blossom as he surfed with his friends and experienced his first taste of victory in a competition. The desire to continuously improve and achieve further victories fueled his competitive fire, leading him to qualify for this year's Championship Tour, the pinnacle of professional surfing. Rio managed to survive the mid-season cut in April, solidifying his place among the world's elite surfers.

Rio's ultimate goal is to become the world champion, following in the footsteps of legendary surfers like Kelly Slater and Mick Fanning, who are his personal heroes. Additionally, he aspires to bring home a gold medal for Indonesia from the Olympics, recognizing the significance it would hold for his country.

While Indonesia is renowned for its world-class surf breaks, Rio acknowledges that the lack of representation from the country at the top level of the sport is due to various factors. One reason is the high cost associated with traveling on the surfing tour, making it financially challenging for Indonesian surfers to participate regularly. Moreover, the locals are often reluctant to leave their home country, which offers consistent, ideal wave conditions. Rio believes that in order to succeed, Indonesian surfers must be willing to compete in various conditions and locations around the world.

The financial burden of pursuing a professional surfing career is another obstacle faced by aspiring surfers, especially those competing at lower levels. Prize money is limited, securing sponsorships can be difficult, and the costs of travel and accommodation are often prohibitive. To mitigate these challenges, the World Surf League has implemented a "pathway to pro" framework, which includes the Regional Qualifying Series, providing emerging surfers with the opportunity to compete closer to home and reduce travel expenses. Rio receives support from his sponsors, Quiksilver and Samudera Indonesia, and the Indonesian government also offers assistance through their national training program. However, he heavily relies on his parents, who have made significant sacrifices to finance his surfing endeavors. His father, working as a construction worker in Japan since 2008, provides support, while his mother films his waves from the shoreline, enabling him to refine his technique.

Grateful for his parents' unwavering support, Rio is motivated to give back to them. He hopes to help them enjoy life and alleviate their financial burdens by earning more money through his surfing career. Even as a rookie on the Championship Tour, Rio has already considered ways to support other Indonesian surfers aiming to reach the highest levels of the sport. He dreams of coaching and training aspiring surfers in Indonesia, bridging the gap and providing the necessary support for them to compete on the global stage.

Throughout this season, Rio has faced formidable opponents, including multiple world champions such as Kelly Slater, Gabriel Medina, and John John Florence. Despite being a rookie, he has impressed with strong performances at events like the Billabong Pro Pipeline in Hawaii and the MEO Rip Curl Pro Portugal. Although recent competitions in Australia resulted in disappointing outcomes, causing him to drop in the rankings, Rio remains determined to learn and improve. Currently ranked 20th in the world, he has four events remaining this season, including the upcoming Surf City El Salvador Pro.

Rio describes his first year on the tour as a significant learning curve. He emphasizes that he didn't place undue pressure on himself, but rather focused on absorbing knowledge and honing his skills. Surfing against the best in the world is an arduous task, requiring unwavering commitment and effort. Rio acknowledges that there are no shortcuts and that he must give his all on every wave.

Being a professional surfer demands a relentless dedication to the sport. When he is back home, Rio spends six to eight hours a day surfing, complemented by five days a week of strength training and conditioning. His routine consists of surfing, eating, sleeping, and training, leaving little room for other activities. During competitions, he prioritizes restful sleep, proper nutrition, stretching, meditation, and limits his time spent on social media. When negative thoughts arise, Rio reminds himself of his journey, starting from his early days when he was fearful of the ocean. Realizing how far he has come, he cherishes the opportunity to live his dream of being a professional surfer.

Rio Waida's remarkable rise to the upper echelons of professional surfing serves as an inspiration to aspiring surfers in Indonesia and beyond. Overcoming personal fears, financial challenges, and the absence of Indonesian representation in the sport, Rio has carved a path for himself through determination, hard work, and the unwavering support of his family. As he continues to pursue his dreams, Rio aims to uplift Indonesian surfing and support future generations of surfers to reach their full potential. The journey has not been easy, but Rio's resilience and commitment demonstrate that success can be achieved, even in the face of adversity.

Looking ahead, Rio Waida remains focused on his goals and aspirations. While he acknowledges the challenges and competitiveness of the Championship Tour, he is determined to make his mark and continue improving his performance. With four events left in the season, including the upcoming Surf City El Salvador Pro, Rio is eager to showcase his skills and climb up the rankings.

The support and encouragement he has received from the surfing community, both in Indonesia and around the world, have been instrumental in his journey. Fellow surfers admire his talent, perseverance, and the positive representation he brings to Indonesian surfing. His achievements have sparked hope and excitement among young surfers in his home country, inspiring them to pursue their own dreams of becoming professional athletes.

Beyond his personal ambitions, Rio is committed to giving back and supporting the Indonesian surfing community. He envisions a future where more Indonesian surfers can compete on the global stage. Rio's desire to coach and train aspiring surfers reflects his dedication to nurturing talent and providing opportunities for others to succeed.

His journey serves as a reminder that success in any field requires sacrifice, hard work, and a supportive network. Rio's parents' unwavering commitment to his dreams exemplifies the importance of familial support and the sacrifices loved ones make to help individuals achieve their goals.

As Rio Waida continues to ride the waves of success, he remains grounded and grateful for the opportunities that surfing has provided him. His determination, passion, and unwavering love for the sport will undoubtedly propel him towards even greater achievements in the future.

In the ever-evolving world of professional surfing, Rio Waida stands as a symbol of hope, resilience, and the indomitable spirit of a surfer chasing their dreams. His journey is a testament to the power of perseverance, and his story will inspire generations of surfers to believe in themselves, overcome obstacles, and reach for the stars. As he carves his path in the competitive surfing world, Rio Waida is destined to leave an indelible mark on the sport and inspire countless others to follow their passion, no matter how challenging the journey may be.
