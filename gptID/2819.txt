Subtitle: Millions of people in the US affected by Canadian wildfire smoke; experts share advice to stay healthy and safe

Date: June 8, 2023

As smoke from raging Canadian wildfires blankets parts of the United States, millions of people find themselves under air quality alerts. The East Coast, in particular, is grappling with the effects of this smoke, leading to the cancellation of outdoor activities in schools and causing delays and ground stops at airports due to poor visibility. Alongside these disruptions, health risks associated with wildfire smoke have become a growing concern. The smoke can lead to various health problems, including trouble breathing, burning eyes, dizziness, headache, and nausea. Medical professionals urge individuals experiencing worsening symptoms to seek medical attention promptly.

To address these concerns and promote public health during such challenging conditions, experts have provided essential information on minimizing the health risks of wildfire smoke.

Understanding the Impact of Wildfire Smoke on Breathing

Dr. Shilpa Patel, the medical director of Children's National IMPACT DC Asthma Clinic in Washington, explains that wildfire smoke contains small particulate matter that irritates the airways, causing coughing and throat discomfort. The Air Quality Index (AQI) is used to assess pollution levels and determine the severity of the situation. Dr. Patel notes that the current air quality conditions are rarely seen in their area, with the index reaching the purple zone.

The Importance of Monitoring Air Quality

Dr. Peter DeCarlo, an associate professor in the Department of Environmental Health and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, emphasizes the significance of regularly checking the AirNow.gov website. This platform provides the most up-to-date information on air quality measurements and forecasts, offering valuable insights into areas affected by poor air quality. Similar to checking weather forecasts, regularly monitoring the air quality index can help individuals make informed decisions about their outdoor activities.

Vulnerable Populations and Health Risks

Certain groups are particularly vulnerable to the health risks associated with poor air quality. Dr. Aida Capo, a pulmonologist with Hackensack Meridian Palisades Medical Center in New Jersey, states that people with asthma, allergies, the elderly, and pregnant individuals are at higher risk. It is strongly recommended that they avoid spending time outside, refrain from exercising outdoors, and stay away from traffic areas that can contribute to additional pollution. Individuals with respiratory problems, such as those with long Covid, should take extra precautions, as any further insult to their lungs could be detrimental to their health.

The Impact on Children and the Elderly

Children and the elderly face specific challenges due to poor air quality. Dr. Patel explains that their ability to expectorate, or clear mucus from the respiratory system, is reduced, making it harder to remove irritants from the airways. Additionally, children have smaller airways, exacerbating the impact of inflammation or mucus, further compromising their breathing. Dr. Rosenberg, a pulmonary disease specialist, warns that even young adults can be affected due to incomplete lung development.

Protective Measures for Outdoor Exposure

While it is recommended to avoid outdoor activities during periods of poor air quality, there are steps individuals can take to protect themselves when venturing outside. Dr. Capo suggests wearing an N95 mask, which is more effective in filtering out small particles compared to surgical masks. Minimizing strenuous physical activities that require deep breathing is also advised, and individuals should be aware that even if they do not experience immediate discomfort, the effects of exposure can manifest later.

Recognizing Warning Signs and Seeking Shelter

Dr. Rosenberg highlights the importance of recognizing warning signs such as irritation in the nose, throat, and eyes. These symptoms can indicate harmful inhalation, prompting individuals to seek shelter and minimize exposure. Pet owners are advised to limit their pets' outdoor time and reduce physical activity during periods of poor air quality.

Precautions for Individuals with Pre-existing Conditions

For individuals with asthma, allergies, or cardiovascular conditions, taking preventive measures before going outside is crucial. Dr. Capo advises using rescue inhalers 15 minutes prior to exposure and continuing prescribed treatments to reduce the risk of exacerbating their condition. Dr. Patel adds that individuals with asthma should ensure they have their rescue inhalers and use them with an AeroChamber for optimal effectiveness. Prompt use of inhalers at the first sign of cough or irritation is recommended, with further medical attention sought if symptoms persist.

Improving Indoor Air Quality

When indoors, individuals can take steps to improve air quality. Closing windows, using air conditioners, and employing air filters can help reduce the concentration of pollutants inside the home. Dr. DeCarlo advises against vacuuming during periods of poor air quality to avoid stirring up particles and increased physical activity.

Allergy Medications and Coping Strategies

While allergy medications can help alleviate some symptoms associated with irritants, they may not address all aspects of wildfire smoke exposure. Dr. Patel suggests that antihistamines, known for drying out mucus, may offer some relief, especially for those with allergic components. However, it is essential to consult with a healthcare provider regarding individual needs.

Long-Term Implications and Future Considerations

Experts acknowledge that the current situation represents a temporary episode of poor air quality. Dr. DeCarlo urges people to take this opportunity to minimize strenuous activities until conditions improve. However, the frequency of wildfires is expected to increase with climate change, making the experience more common in the future. As such, understanding the risks and implementing preventive measures will become increasingly vital for public health and safety.

The Role of Local Authorities and Communities

Local authorities play a crucial role in providing information and guidance during periods of poor air quality. Dr. DeCarlo emphasizes the importance of following their recommendations, such as avoiding outdoor activities or using designated clean air spaces. Communities can also come together to support vulnerable individuals by offering assistance, checking on neighbors, and providing resources to minimize the impact of wildfire smoke.

Preparing for Future Wildfire Seasons

Given the projected increase in wildfires, it is crucial to prepare for future seasons. Dr. Rosenberg emphasizes the need for public awareness campaigns that educate individuals on the health risks associated with wildfire smoke and the measures they can take to protect themselves. This includes having an emergency plan in place, keeping necessary medications and supplies readily available, and staying informed about local air quality conditions.

Collaboration Between Health and Environmental Agencies

To address the complex issue of wildfire smoke and its impact on public health, collaboration between health and environmental agencies is essential. Dr. Capo stresses the importance of interdisciplinary efforts to monitor and mitigate the effects of poor air quality. This includes close coordination between meteorological services, air quality monitoring agencies, healthcare providers, and public health officials to ensure timely dissemination of information and effective response strategies.

Research and Innovation for Better Solutions

Experts call for increased research and innovation to develop better solutions for mitigating the health risks of wildfire smoke. This includes advancing air filtration technologies, improving the effectiveness of personal protective equipment, and exploring strategies to minimize the environmental impact of wildfires. Continued investment in these areas can lead to more effective prevention and response measures, ultimately safeguarding public health during wildfire events.

In conclusion, the health risks associated with wildfire smoke demand proactive measures to protect individuals and communities. By staying informed, taking preventive actions, and seeking appropriate medical care when needed, people can reduce the adverse effects of poor air quality. As we face the challenges posed by climate change and its impact on wildfires, it is crucial to prioritize public health and work collectively to develop sustainable solutions for a healthier and safer future.
